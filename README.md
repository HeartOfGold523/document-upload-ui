This project was an interview assessment for a frontend engineering position. I was given a screenshot of a webpage and asked to recreate it as closely as possible. Buttons, toggles, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc. don't actually do anything - simply console logged instead as per the instructions. For extra credit, I have added "functionality" to the file upload input where once a file is selected, a progress bar and the file details are displayed on screen. For instructions on how to run the app, please see the default generated Next.js README below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
